# Current Session Context

## What We're Doing
Working through CodeRabbit PR review comments for PR #102 (redo functionality) one at a time.

## Current Status
**Currently on: Issue #3 - Atomicity in UndoLastOperation**

### Completed
1. ✅ **Issue #1**: Test failures - Fixed `InsertIndex` bug in remove operations and `MaxRedoHistorySize` test
2. ✅ **Issue #2**: Thread safety with mutex protection
   - Added `sync.Mutex` to protect global undo/redo state
   - Created internal `*Locked()` versions of functions to avoid deadlocks
   - **Fixed deadlock bug**: Moved `isUndoing/isRedoing` check BEFORE lock acquisition in `recordOperation()`
   - All tests pass ✅

### Next Steps (Remaining CodeRabbit Issues)
3. **Issue #3**: Atomicity bug in `UndoLastOperation` - Apply operations BEFORE moving between stacks
4. **Issue #4**: Atomicity bug in `RedoLastOperation` - Same issue as #3
5. **Issue #5**: Status message bug in `undo()` - Capture description BEFORE executing undo
6. **Issue #6**: Status message bug in `redo()` - Same issue as #5
7. **Issue #7**: Keyboard shortcut conflict (Ctrl+R) - Document potential browser conflict
8. **Issue #8**: Add more test coverage - Menu events and CanRedo() false case
9. **Issue #9**: Include operation description in menu labels - "Undo Copy chunk" instead of "Undo"
10. **Issue #10**: Performance - Fetch undo/redo state concurrently with Promise.all
11. **Issue #11**: Naming - Rename `refreshUndoState` to `refreshUndoRedoState`
12. **Issue #12**: Linter - Use `void updateUndoRedoState()` in onMount
13. **Issue #13**: Fix unused Biome suppressions - 7 warnings in frontend files

## Files Modified (Issue #2)
- `backend/undo_operations.go` - Added mutex and locking to all functions

## Key Implementation Details
- Pattern: Public functions acquire lock, call internal `*Locked()` versions
- Prevents deadlocks when functions call each other
- Example: `BeginOperationGroup()` locks and calls `beginOperationGroupLocked()`, which can safely call `commitOperationGroupLocked()`

## Command Currently Running
```bash
just test-backend
```
Running in background (bash_id: e68f51) to verify mutex doesn't break tests.
