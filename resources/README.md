- `appicon.icns` - macOS application icon
- `appicon.png` - Main application icon (512x512)
- `sample-files/` - Test files for manual testing and development

## Icon Specifications

The application icon features:
- Orange background (RGB: 255, 150, 50)
- Blue welding mask (RGB: 59, 109, 179)
- Darker blue visor window (RGB: 42, 87, 145)

The welding mask design represents the tool's purpose of "welding" together file differences, similar to how a welder joins metal pieces.
